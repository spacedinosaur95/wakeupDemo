# wakeupDemo
a demo app that demonstrates that I've learned to: 
-make an R shiny dashboard
-do some data visualization in R 
-embed Neo4j into Java
-use Java package in R to display Neo4j graph in Shiny app 

The web application explores data from Shuttle wakeup calls... the set of data is not a complete set of all the Shuttle missions...

The data used for this app came from this source: http://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf
